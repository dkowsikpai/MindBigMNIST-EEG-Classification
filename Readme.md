EEG is becoming increasingly used for getting data from the brain for helping in disabled assistance, criminal detection, patient monitoring, and communication. Faster communication is necessary as the
signals depend on the attention person gives to the image, and no one likes buffering. In this paper, we will be doing study on reducing the number of electrodes used for gathering information and analyzing the speed
and accuracy of some of the algorithms. Our experiments have shown comparable results on processed and unprocessed data of the MindBigData MNIST dataset. Machine learning models and deep learning models were able to achieve above baseline accuracy. Experiments have shown
that we are able achieve 55Î¼s in classifying a data sample.
